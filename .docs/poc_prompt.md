Proof-of-Concept Prompt: Basic Gift management app

Objective: Create a minimal Proof of Concept (PoC) application for managing people and gifts, based on the MVP described in the PRD and the tech stack detailed in the tech-stack.md.

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: Astro with React for interactive components, TypeScript for static typing and improved IDE support, Tailwind CSS for styling, and optionally Shadcn/ui for accessible React component libraries.

Core Functionalities (only include essential features, excluding extraneous options):
1. People Management:
   - Add a new person with essential fields: name and description.
   - Edit and remove an existing person.
   - Display a list of people.
2. Gifts Management:
   - Add a new gift with minimal fields: name, price, link, and description.
   - Edit and remove an existing gift.
   - Display a list of gifts.
3. Assigning Gifts to People:
   - Provide the ability to assign a gift to a particular person (both during creation and editing).

Requirements:
- Only implement the core functionalities mentioned above. All additional features such as notifications, advanced filtering, reminders, and mobile support should be omitted.
- The generator must first create a detailed work plan that includes:
  - A breakdown of the work into clear stages (e.g., architecture design, frontend implementation, testing).
  - A list of key tasks for each stage.
- Obtain my approval on the detailed plan before starting the actual development of the PoC.
